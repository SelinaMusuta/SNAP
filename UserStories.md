User Stories for SNAP
Lead Developer: Selina Musuta


User Story 1:  As an owner of a farmer's market, I want to be able to let SNAP participants that I will be selling fresh fruit and veggies and that they can purchase with their EBT.

User Story 2:  As a SNAP user that cooks for my family, I want a recipe tool that gives me recipes for meals under $10 so that I can get the most out of my EBT.

User Story 3: As a SNAP recipient,  I want to use a tool that calculates my potential grocery bill to my EBT balance so that I can budget before I get to the register.
